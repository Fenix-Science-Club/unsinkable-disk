Abstract
========
Although it is commonly expected that a metal disk placed on the surface of water will sink, our investigation
has revealed a surprising phenomenon: a vertical jet directed onto the disk from above can allow it to remain
afloat. This result defies intuition, as one would assume that the force of the jet’s impact would cause the
disk to sink. We have discovered that this phenomenon occurs as a result of water displacement from the top
of the disk caused by the impacting jet, operating through a mechanism similar to the hydraulic jump. This
displacement generates a difference in hydrostatic pressures, resulting in an upward buoyancy force capable of
balancing the force of gravity. In contrast to the classical case, here the jump radius is fixed by the geometric
parameters of a disk, a phenomenon we refer to as the boundary jump. To further explore this effect, we have
presented a theoretical model based on scaling laws, which provides the conditions required for the disk to float.
The dimensionless scaling constant’s value was determined through an independent experiment. Finally, we
conducted experiments on the disk’s floating and sinking, which showed a good match with the proposed theory.
